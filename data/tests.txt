	single-row move() and combine() tests:
		2,0,0,0 → 0,0,0,2
		just move the block across the board

		0,2,0,0 → 0,0,0,2
		check for index out of bounds errors

		0,0,0,2 → 0,0,0,2
		testing keeping the block in place

		2,4,0,0 → 0,0,2,4
		ignoring combinations by making different values

		0,0,2,4 → 0,0,2,4
		testing keeping multiple blocks in place

		0,0,2,2 → 0,0,0,4
		testing combine()

		2,2,0,0 → 0,0,0,4
		testing combine() and move() together

		0,2,2,2 → find this out later. likely would be 0,0,2,4

		2,2,2,2 → 0,0,4,4
		testing nested combinations

		2,4,8,16 → 2,4,8,16
		making sure that other number work as well

		representation of input/output:
			input is represented as a list of Numbers
			Number class has: columnIndex, rowIndex, and value
			list of Numbers should be updated every single time a block is moved
			output list of Numbers

	multi-row move() and combine() tests:
		to be done tomorrow
